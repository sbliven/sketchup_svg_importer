SketchUp SVG Importer
=====================

This is a plugin for SketchUp versions 6+. Use it to import simple SVG images
into SketchUp, where they can be extruded into 3D and further modified.

This version extends the [excellent script](http://rhin.crai.archi.fr/rld/plugin_details.php?id=435)
by Uli Tessel with some additional features and bug fixes.

## Installation

Copy *svg_import.rb* file and *svg_import* folder to your plugins folder. On Windows, this will be *%APPDATA%\SketchUp\SketchUp #\SketchUp\Plugins*.
On a Mac, *~/Library/Application Support/SketchUp #/SketchUp/Plugins*.

All dependencies are already included.

## Usage

The plugin adds a 'Import SVG File...' option in the Plugins menu. The SVG will
be imported into a new group. The object structure within the SVG will be
preserved, meaning that groups of objects within the SVG will become nested
groups in SketchUp. Note that several explode operations may be required to
move geometry into the top-level model.

## Global Flags

The following flags can be set using the Ruby console to help with debugging
and change some behaviours:

* _$svgImportScriptDebug _If true, print debugging information

## Limitations

The plugin can currently handle only a limited subset of the SVG format.
Unsupported features typically print a warning to the ruby console and then are
ignored.

When using Inkscape, the following hints can produce simpler, more compatible
svg output

* Convert all objects to paths before exporting (text, polygons, etc)
* Save files as 'Plain SVG' ('Simple SVG' in some locales)

## Known Bugs/Missing features

These are not implemented, but have been started or planned. Additional feature
requests can be made on
[github](https://github.com/sbliven/sketchup_svg_importer/issues)

* Additional SVG Types
  * line, polyline, polygon, text
  * Additional path commands (arc, quadratic bezier, etc)
* Localization
  * The 'french' branch contains french translations of some messages. If some
    french speaker would be interested in updating this branch with the latest
    features it would be great.
* 3D-specific attributes
  * It might be interesting to use some attributes (like the color of a stroke) to
    control the Z-Value. With this common trick it is possible to use Inkscape
    for some kind of 2.5D.
* Bug: faces are not created correctly: too many, holes are wrong, etc.
